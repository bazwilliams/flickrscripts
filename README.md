Flickr Scripts

A pile or random python scripts to handle the metadata file downloaded using hte Flickrbackup utility. 

The Flickr.py is a module which loads this metadata file and provides convenient access to tags, titles and descriptions based on the flickr assigned ID. 

I used this to reconstitute my images some of which only lived on flickr; but more importantly I used the combine_metadata.py script to update the Exif data directly with tags, titles and descriptions I'd annotated only on Flickr. 

The compare_metadata.py was an attempt at ensuring all files had been merged. 

The flickrbackup is provided by http://hsivonen.iki.fi/photobackup/
